    STAR LANES IS A GAME OF INTERSTELLAR TRADING.
    THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO AMASS THE GREATEST AMOUNT
    OF MONEY.  THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY ESTABLISHING VAST,
    INTERSTELLAR SHIPPING LANES, AND PURCHASING STOCK IN
    THE COMPANIES THAT CONTROL THOSE TRADE ROUTES.  DURING
    THE COURSE OF THE GAME, STOCK APPRECIATES IN VALUE AS
    THE SHIPPING COMPANIES BECOME LARGER.  ALSO, SMALLER
    COMPANIES CAN BE MERGED INTO LARGER ONES, AND STOCK
    IN THE SMALLER FIRM IS CONVERTED INTO STOCK IN THE
    LARGER ONE AS DESCRIBED BELOW.

    EACH TURN, THE COMPUTER WILL PRESENT THE PLAYER WITH
    FIVE PROSPECTIVE SPACES TO OCCUPY ON A 9X12 MATRIX
    (ROWS 1-9, COLUMNS A-L).  THE PLAYER, AFTER EXAMINING
    THE MAP OF THE GALAXY TO DECIDE WHICH SPACE HE WISHES
    TO OCCUPY, RESPONDS WITH THE ROW AND COLUMN OF THAT
    SPACE, I.E., 7E, 8A, ETC.  THERE ARE FOUR POSSIBLE
    MOVES A PLAYER CAN MAKE.

    1. HE CAN ESTABLISH AN UNATTACHED OUTPOST- IF HE
    SELECTS A SPACE THAT IS NOT ADJACENT TO A STAR, ANOTHER
    UNATTACHED OUTPOST, OR AN EXISTING SHIPPING LANE, THIS
    SPACE WILL BE DESIGNATED WITH A '+'.  HE WILL THEN PROCEED
    WITH STOCK TRANSACTIONS, AS LISTED BELOW.

    2. HE CAN ADD TO AN EXISTING LANE- IF HE SELECTS A
    SPACE THAT IS ADJACENT TO ONE - AND ONLY ONE EXISTING
    SHIPPING LANE, THE SPACE HE SELECTS WILL BE ADDED TO
    THAT SHIPPING LANE AND WILL BE DISIGNATED WITH THE FIRST
    LETTER OF THE COMPANY THAT OWNS THAT LANE.  IF THERE ARE
    ANY STARS OR UNATTACHED OUTPOSTS ALSO ADJACENT TO THE
    SELECTED SPACE, THEY, TOO, WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE
    EXISTING LANE.  EACH NEW SQUARE ADJACENT TO A STAR ADDS
    $500 PER SHARE, AND EACH NEW OUTPOST ADDS $100 PER SHARE
    TO THE MARKET VALUE OF THE STOCK OF THAT COMPANY.

    3. HE MAY ESTABLISH A NEW SHIPPING LANE- IF THERE
    ARE FIVE OR LESS EXISTING SHIPPING LANES ESTABLISHED,
    THE PLAYER MAY, GIVEN THE PROPER SPACE TO PLAY, ESTABLISH
    A NEW SHIPPING LANE.  HE MAY DO THIS BY OCCUPYING A SPACE
    ADJACENT TO A STAR OR ANOTHER UNATTACHED OUTPOST, BUT
    NOT ADJACENT TO AN EXISTING SHIPPING LANE.  IF HE
    ESTABLISHES A NEW SHIPPING LANE, HE IS AUTOMATICALLY
    ISSUED 5 SHARES KN THE NEW COMPANY AS A REWARD.  HE
    MAY THEN PROCEED TO BUY STOCK IN ANY ACTIVE COMPANY,
    INCLUDKNG THE ONE JUST FORMED, AS DESCRIBED BELOW.
    THG MARKET VALUE OF THE NEW STOCK IS ESTABLISHED BY
    THE NUMBER OF STARS AND OCCUPIED SPACES AS DESCRIBED
    IN #2 ABOVE.

    4.  HE MAY MERGE TWO EXISTING COMPANIES- IF A PLAYER
    SELECTS A SPACE ADJACENT TO TWO EXISTING SHIPPING
    LANES, A MERGER OCCURS.  THE LARGER COMPANY TAKES OVER THE
    SMALLER COMPANY - (IF BOTH COMPANIES ARE THE SAME SIZE
    PRIOR TO THE MERGER, THEN THE SURVIVOR IS DETERMINED BY
    ALPHABETICAL ORDER OF THE TWO COMPANY NAMES - THE EARLIER
    SURVIVES).  THE STOCK OF THE SURVIVING COMPANY IS
    INCREASED IN VALUE ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF SPACES
    AND STARS ADDED TO ITS LANE.  EACH PLAYERS STOCK IN
    THE DEFUNCT COMPANY IS EXCHANGED FOR SHARES KN THE
    SURVIVOR ON A RATIO OF 2 FOR 1.  ALSO, EACH PLAYER
    IS PAID A CASH BONUS PROPORTIONAL TO THE PERCENTAGE
    OF OUTSTANDING STOCK HE HELD IN THE DEFUNCT COMPANY.
    NOTE: AFTER A COMPANY BECOMES DEFUNCT THROUGH THE
    MERGER PROCESS, IT CAN REAPPEAR ELSEWHERE ON THE
    BOARD WHEN, AND IF, A NEW COMPANY IS ESTABLISHED.

    NEXT THE COMPUTER CDDS STOCK DIVIDENDS TO THE PLAYER'S
    CASH ON HAND (5% OF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE STOCK IN HIS
    POSSESSION), AND OFFERS HIM THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE
    STOCK KN ANY OF THE ACTIVE COMPANIES ON THE BOARD.
    STOCK MAY NOT BE SOLD, BUT THE MARKET VALUE OF EACH
    PLAYER'S STOCK IS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AT THE END OF THE
    GAME TO DETERMINE THE WINNER. IF THE OARKET VALUE OF A GIVEN
    STOCK EXCEEDS $3000 AT ANY TIME DURING THE GAME, THAT
    STOCK SPLITS 2 FOR 1.  THE PRICE IS CUT IN HALF, AND
    THE NUMBER OF SHARES OWNED BY GACH PLAYER IS DOUBLED.

    NOTE:  THE PLAYER MAY LOOK AT HIS PORTFOLIO AT ANY TIME
    DURING THE COURSE OF HIS TURN BY RESPONDING WITH 'STOCK'
    TO AN INPUT STATEMENT.  LIKEWISE, HE CAN REVIEW THE MAP
    OF THE GALAXY BY TYPING 'MAP' TO AN INPUT STATEMENT.

    ** GAME ENDS AFTER 48 MOVES **

    PLAYER WITH THE GREATEST NET WORTH AT THAT POINT IS THE WINNER.
